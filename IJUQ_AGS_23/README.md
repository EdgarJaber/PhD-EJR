# Sensitivity Analysis with OpenTURNS

This GitHub repository contains the source-codes developed for the results in the article *Sensitivity Analysis for a Multi-physics Clogging Simulation code* ([arXiv:2401.05741](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05741.pdf)). 
Its main purpose is applying the uncertainty quantification tools (Polynomial Chaos Expansions, Sobol' and HSIC indices) present in the [OpenTURNS](http://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/contents.html) Python library to a time-dependent output.

The /scripts/ folder contains the relevant Jupyter notebooks following the order of the article sections and all corresponding plots are found in the /plots/ folder.

Due to industrial privacy, the data.zip folder is momentarily password protected. It can be given upon request by writing me at edgar.jaber@ens-paris-saclay.fr
