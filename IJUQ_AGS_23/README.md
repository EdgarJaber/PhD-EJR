# Sensitivity Analysis with OpenTURNS

This GitHub repo reassembles the source-codes used in the article *Sensitivity Analysis for a Multi-physics Clogging Simulation code* ([arXiv:2401.05741](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05741.pdf)). 

Its main purpose is applying the uncertainty quantification tools (polynomial chaos expansions, Sobol' and HSIC indices) present in the [OpenTURNS](http://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/contents.html) Python library.

The notebooks are structured as in the paper.
