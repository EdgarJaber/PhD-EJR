Its main purpose is to apply several uncertainty quantification tools (e.g., Polynomial Chaos Expansions, Sobol' and HSIC indices) available in the [OpenTURNS](http://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/contents.html) C++/Python library.

The /scripts/ folder contains the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks in the order of the article sections, and all corresponding plots are in the /plots/ folder.
