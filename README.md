# Sensitivity Analyses of a Multi-Physics Long-Term Clogging Model for Steam Generators with OpenTURNS

This GitHub repo reassembles the source code used in the article *Sensitivity Analyses of a Multi-Physics Long-Term Clogging Model for Steam Generators* published in the International Journal for Uncertainty Quantification:
- [DOI: 10.1615/Int.J.UncertaintyQuantification.2024051489](https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/references/52034eb04b657aea,forthcoming,51489.html)

- [arXiv:2401.05741](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05741.pdf). 

Its main purpose is to apply several uncertainty quantification tools (e.g., Polynomial Chaos Expansions, Sobol' and HSIC indices) available in the [OpenTURNS](http://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/contents.html) C++/Python library.

The /scripts/ folder contains the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks in the order of the article sections, and all corresponding plots are in the /plots/ folder.
